<h2>Go Error Propagation</h2>
<p>
    Error handling is a vital part of any programming language. There's 
    any number of things that can go wrong if you interact with the outside 
    world. A file can be missing or corrupt, an endpoint temporarily unreachable,
    a database server down, etc. Things can go wrong everywhere.
    Now in order to keep the systems we work on maintainable and user friendly,
    we have to handle these errors appropriately.
</p>
<p>
    Different languages offer different mechanisms for handling errors.
    Most modern programming languages, for example, include a feature called 
    <b>exceptions</b> as a convenient
    way to propagate errors through <b>multiple</b>
    layers. This feature is missing in Go - and that's on purpose.
</p>
<p>
    In the following sections we'll explore some common methods for avoiding
    error handling. I like call these <b>anti-patterns</b> or <b>"don'ts"</b>
</p>
<h2>Method 1: Ignore</h2>
<p>
    The first anti-pattern in error handling - and this is <b>not</b> limited 
    to go - is ignoring them alltogether. Here is a piece of code that makes excessive
    use of the underscore (<b>_</b>). The underscore, also known as the 
    <b>blank identifier</b>, is used when calling functions with multiple
    return values to discard one of these values.
</p>
<p>
    Let's have a look at the example
</p>
<pre><code>// file: main.go

package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    cont := doWork("google.com")

    log.Println(cont)
}

func doWork(host string) string {
    client := &amp;http.Client{}

    req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", host, nil)

    req.Header.Add("Accept", "application/json")
    req.AddCookie(&amp;http.Cookie{Name: "ID", Value: "1B2EB10C8ADDE70440A2EFBA15C2C6CD"})

    resp, _ := client.Do(req)

    b, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)

    return string(b)
}</code></pre>
<p>
    Looks good enough, right? So there is this <b>doWork</b> function that calls an 
    API endpoint with a cookie, then reads the contents and returns them.
    Now running this will result in a <b>SIGSEGV</b>, a segmentation fault.
    Meaning, that one of the errors in the code is not <b>nil</b> and the 
    corresponding unignored value therefore is. 
</p>
<p>
    We clearly don't want code like this in our production systems. Let's try 
    something different.
</p>

<h2>Method 2: Delegate</h2>
<p>
    Since go is <em>annoying</em> and doesn't let us propagate the errors to
    the next layer, we can just try replicate that missing feature ourselves.
    What if we <b>delegate</b> the error to the calling function? We can just
    "offshore" the work to the poor fellow who will be interacting with our API.
</p>
<p>
    Let's have a peak what that might look like with our example
</p>
<pre><code>// file: main.go

// ...

func main() {
    cont, err := doWork("google.com")

    if err != nil {
        log.Panicln(err)
    }

    log.Println(cont)
}

func doWork(host string) (string, error) {
    client := &amp;http.Client{}

    req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", host, nil)

    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    req.Header.Add("Accept", "application/json")
    req.AddCookie(&amp;http.Cookie{Name: "ID", Value: "1B2EB10C8ADDE70440A2EFBA15C2C6CD"})

    resp, err := client.Do(req)

    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    b, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)

    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    return string(b), nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    We've added error delegation inbetween the business logic. The 
    caller now gets a <em>mysterious</em> error message together with a trace
    that tells her where the error is originating. 
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">
$ go run main.go
panic: Get google.com: unsupported protocol scheme ""
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is marginally more useful
    than just crashing, I admit it, yet, not user friendly at all. So how can
    we improve that?
</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>
    Let's say Lisa is interacting with our system. Now she's getting an error 
    from our API. What Lisa would like to know is
</p>
<blockquote>
    How can I adjust the input value to get rid of the error? What am I doing wrong?
</blockquote>
<p>
    This is a difficult question to answer. What we can easily answer is
</p>
<blockquote>
    What part of the system was I interacting with that produced the error?
</blockquote>
<p>
    Let's glance at an example
</p>
<pre><code>// file: main.go

// ...

func doWork(host string) (string, error) {
    client := &amp;http.Client{}

    req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", host, nil)

    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("Failed to create a new request: %v", err)
    }

    req.Header.Add("Accept", "application/json")
    req.AddCookie(&amp;http.Cookie{Name: "ID", Value: "1B2EB10C8ADDE70440A2EFBA15C2C6CD"})

    resp, err := client.Do(req)

    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("Failed to execute the request with host \"%s\": %v", host, err)
    }

    b, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)

    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("Failed to read from request body: %v", err)
    }

    return string(b), nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the corresponding output</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ go run main.go
panic: Failed to execute the request with host "google.com": Get google.com: unsupported protocol scheme ""
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now Lisa knows that we were trying to dispatch the request as the error happened. 
    Together with the trace, I'd argue, she has a better chance of finding out what
    changes she has to make to fix her code.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    There is no magic formula to getting error handling right. We
    just have consider the poor person interacting with our code.
    Make it a better experience for them.
</p>
<p>
    Here are a few <em>best practices</em> around error handling. Some of them
    not covered by the scope of this article.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Try to give the programmer a hint of where the code is failing</li>
    <li><b>Always</b> include the trace for internal APIs</li>
    <li>Hide error information from end users. This might expose a security flaw in your system</li>
    <li>
        Try to fail softly. Some errors can be recovered from.
        <ul>
            <li>Few errors should render a service unfunctional</li>
            <li>
                If, for example, the billing service is unresponsive, simply 
                display a message instead of a internal server error
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
</ul>
