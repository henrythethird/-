<h2>Bitcoin Script</h2>
<p>
    <b>Bitcoin Script</b> is a stack based programming language.
    It enables bitcoin users to build functionality on top of the blockchain, much
    like <em>Solidity</em> on top of <b>Ethereum</b>. In contrast to Solidity, Bitcoin
    script is, by design, not a Turing complete language.
