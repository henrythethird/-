<h2>Test Engineering</h2>
<p>
    Writing tests is a common practice, especially for firms that leverage
    continuous delivery. With this article I'd like to explain some 
    methods that can be used to generate test cases. The following
    methods are covered in the scope of the post
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Equivalence partitioning and boundary values</li>
    <li>State transitions</li>
    <li>Path testing</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Let's dive into the details of each method.
</p>

<h3>Partitions and Boundaries</h3>
<p>
    Similar to mathematical functions, in programming a function maps
    inputs from a given domain <b>X</b> to a codomain <b>Y</b>. 
    <b>Equivalence Partitioning</b> (EP) is a method to split the domain 
    <b>X</b> into multiple partitions that exhibit the same behaviour.
    For each partition a single test case is created, thus creating a
    kind of <em>Partition Coverage</em>.
</p>
<p>
    An example will shed light on the methodology
</p>
<pre><code class="go">func CalcPrice(amount uint) {
    if amount > 100 {
        return 10
    }

    if amount > 50 {
        return 11
    }

    if amount > 10 {
        return 15
    }

    return 20
}</code></pre>
<p>
    There are four partitions to this <b>CalcPrice</b> function
</p>
<ol>
    <li>The range from 100 to infinity <b>(100, &infin;)</b></li>
    <li>The range 50 to 100 <b>(50, 100]</b></li>
    <li>The range 10 to 50 <b>(10, 50]</b></li>
    <li>The range up to 10 <b>[0, 10]</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
    EP now recommends to cover each of the partitions in one test.
    <b>Boundary Value Analysis</b> (BVA) extends this definition
    to also include the lower and upper values of the boundaries.
    The reasoning behind this is simple. There are usually a lot
    of issues with the boundaries, since the ranges can either
    be openend or closed on either side.
</p>
<p>
    BVA adds another 8 tests to the list: <em>UINT_MAX, 101, 
    100, 51, 50, 11, 10, 0</em>. Together with EP that results
    in 12 tests, giving a reasonable coverage.
</p>

<h3>State Transitions</h3>
<p>
    Virtually all systems that we design contain some kind of
    state and necessarily also some mechanism to alter that state. 
    In state trainsition analysis, all possible states of a single 
    component and their transitions from on to another are graphed.
</p>
<p>
    Let's take the example of a traffic light. There are four
    different states: <b>Yellow Flahsing</b>, <b>Red</b>, 
    <b>Yellow</b>, <b>Green</b>. <b>Yellow Flashing</b> depicts the
    base state. Together with these states, there are six allowed transitions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Yellow Flashing</b> &rarr; <b>Red</b></li>
    <li><b>Red</b> &rarr; <b>Yellow</b></li>
    <li><b>Yellow</b> &rarr; <b>Green</b></li>
    <li><b>Green</b> &rarr; <b>Yellow</b></li>
    <li><b>Yellow</b> &rarr; <b>Red</b></li>
    <li><b>Red</b> &rarr; <b>Yellow Flashing</b></li>
</ul>
<p>
    When testing state transitions, there should be tests for 
    each transition, be it valid or invalid. The tests are to assert
    that no illegal transitions take place and that the system
    behaves according to the graph.
</p>

<h3>Path Testing</h3>
<p>
    <b>Path testsing</b> is one possibility of making sure that the code we've
    written works as expected. Let's first have a look on how we can measure
    the completeness of our tests.
</p>
<p>
    A measurement of the code that has been tested
    is commonly referred to as <b>Code Coverage</b>.
    There are three different strategies of analyzing code coverage
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Statement Coverage</b> - percentage of statements reached
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Branch Coverage</b> - percentage of conditional decisions reached 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Path Coverage</b> - percentage of paths covered
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The further down we go in the list, the more tests there are to write.
    This simple example illustrates the three types
</p>
<pre><code class="go">func CalculateValue(withVat bool, amount uint) {
    var calcPrice

    if amount > 10 {
        calcPrice = 50
    } else if amount > 20 {
        // Unreachable code
    } else {
        calcPrice = 55
    }

    if withVat {
        calcPrice *= 1.08
    }

    return amount * calcPrice
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now <em>100% statement coverage</em> would require merely <em>two tests</em>.
    One for <b>amount &gt; 10</b> and one for <b>amount &lt; 10</b>, while 
    keeping <b>withVat = true</b> for both.
    These two tests effectively call <em>100%</em> of the statements.
</p>
<p>
    <em>100% branch coverage</em> requires that possible scenario in a 
    branch is tested at least once. We'd also write <em>two tests</em>. One for
    <b>amount &gt; 10 &amp; withVat = true</b> and one <b>amount &lt; 10 
    &amp; withVat = false</b>. We'd also notice that the branch 
    <b>amount > 20</b> in the above code can never be reached, thus 
    potentially finding a bug.
</p>
<p>
    <em>100% path coverage</em> is more exact and thus requires more
    testing effort. For this scenario we'd need <em>four tests</em> 
    (ignoring the <b>amount &gt; 20</b> problem we've already detected)
</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>amount &gt; 10 &amp; withVat = true</b></li>
    <li><b>amount &lt; 10 &amp; withVat = true</b></li>
    <li><b>amount &gt; 10 &amp; withVat = false</b></li>
    <li><b>amount &lt; 10 &amp; withVat = false</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
    The measurement of path coverage is thus the most thorough and 
    accurate, yet also the most costly to reach.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Path testing</b> is the practice of reaching a high <b>path coverage</b>.
    In this methodology, tests are extracted according to all the paths that 
    lead through our code.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    The three methods above should give the reader a starting point
    of how tests can be engineered. The list is by no means complete.
