<h2>Testable Code</h2>
<p>
    Testing has quickly become a standard in the software industry. Writing
    testable code is quite simple when following a few simple guidelines. This 
    post aims at providing you with a framework for tackling that issue.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>SOLID</b> principle plays a big role when it comes to writing
    testable code. It is an important cornerstone for writing high quality and 
    maintainable code. Together with <b>Dependency Injection</b> it lays the
    foundation of testability. The following principles comprise the base recipe
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>S</b>ingle Responsibility</li>
    <li><b>O</b>pen-Closed</li>
    <li><b>L</b>iskov Substitution</li>
    <li><b>I</b>nterface Segregation</li>
    <li><b>D</b>ependency Inversion</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following sections explain the principles and how they apply to testability,
    together with examples.
</p>

<h3>Single Responsibility</h3>
<p>
    The <b>Single Responsibility Principle</b> (SRP) states that every component of a system 
    should have one and only one responsibility. Or as Robert C. Martin elegantly phrases it
</p>
<blockquote>A class should have only one reason to change</blockquote>
<p>
    An example of this could be 
</p>
<pre><code class="go">package export

type ExportSvc interface {
    Serialize(interface{}) (string, err)
    WriteToFile(string) err
}

type Exp struct {}

//Exp -> extends interface</code></pre>
<p>
    The <b>Exp</b> struct violates the SRP, because there are two scenarios that require a change in code.
    Number one is the serialization mechanism. Maybe our API will accept json instead of yaml.
    And number two is the access to the file system. Supposedly we switch from <em>write to disk</em>
    to <em>Amazon S3</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Increasingly complex systems to design and maintain imply an increasing number of 
    reasons for change. SRP makes sure that these changes have a small footprint on 
    our codebase. Increased testability of our code is thus reached by narrowing the 
    scope and therefore the complexity of both our tests and their subjects.
</p>

<h3>Open-Closed</h3>
<p>
    The <b>Open-Closed</b> principle (OCP) states, according to it's creator, Bertran Meyer
</p>
<blockquote>
    Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, 
    but closed for modification
</blockquote>
<p>
    Being <b>open</b> for extension means that the behaviour of a given component can be 
    extended. In other words, the behaviour is not set in stone or written in such a manner 
    that extending functionality infers copying of code.
</p>
<p>
    When a component is called <b>closed</b> for modification it means that the public API of 
    this component is fixed. Furthermore, no changes to the code are to be made.
</p>
<p>
    Typically violations of this principle are verbose switch case statements or if-elseif structures. 
    The following example illustrates a clear violation
</p>
<pre><code class="go">package main

type Product struct{
    Type string
    //...
}

type PriceSvc struct{}

func (_ *PriceSvc) GetVAT(p *Product) uint {
    switch p.Type {
    case 'food':
        return 70
    case 'other':
        return 0
    default:
        return 80
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>
    Immagine this code is inside of a library you're using. Now in order to <em>extend</em> the behaviour of
    the <b>GetVAT</b> method by another type, let's say <b>'furniture'</b>, the programmer has to either modify
    the original code or overwrite it completely. When overwriting the code she potentially also has to write 
    test cases for each scenario.
</p>
<p>
    The example could be fixed by introducing a simple mapping table 
    <b>type -> VAT</b>. When adding new product types, another entry
    can be inserted to this table, leaving it open for extension. Furthermore, 
    instead of writing a test case per product type, a single more generic
    test can be written instead.
</p>
<p>
    Software systems are subject to a good deal of change. The <b>OCP</b>, much like the SRP, helps
    us to reduce the impact change has on our system. In practice the two principles go hand in hand, since
    having complex paths in your code, a violation of OCP, normally also implies a violation of the SRP.
</p>

<h3>Liskov Substitution</h3>
<p>
    The <b>Liskov Substitution Principle</b> (LSP) states that if a type <b>S</b> is a subtype
    of type <b>T</b>, then <b>S</b> must include all the same behaviours as <b>T</b>. This has
    profound implications on inheritance in object oriented programming languages. The 
    principle infers that function signatures stay equivalent in subtypes, as well as 
    exceptions that are thrown.
</p>
<p>
    <b>LSP</b> has way more implications, that won't be subject of this post. It is a broad 
    topic that warrants an article on it's own.
</p>

<h3>Interface Segregation</h3>
<p>
    According to the <b>Interface Segregation Principle</b> (ISP), clients ought not be 
    forced to depend on unused methods. In other words, keep your interfaces small and
    segregated.
</p>
<p>
    Violations of this principle are numerous and most often also infer a 
    transgression against the SRP. Here the same example as for the SRP
</p>
<pre><code class="go">package main

type ExportSvc interface {
    Serialize(interface{}) (string, err)
    WriteToFile(string) err
}</code></pre>
<p>
    A possible violation of this is that a client might only need to depend 
    on one the <b>Serialize</b> function. Using this interface, she's also 
    aware of the <b>WriteToFile</b> function which creates an unnecessary 
    dependency. Splitting the interface into two separate interafaces would
    solve the violation, yet still violates the SRP.
</p>
<p>
    When writing tests, ISP enables us to create smaller mock objects of
    the dependencies we're injecting. Thus decreasing the lines of code
    and the complexity.
</p>

<h3>Dependency Inversion</h3>
<p>
    Many programmers hardwire business layers with the utility layers,
    making it harder to replace single components in a system. The 
    <b>Dependency Inversion Principle</b> (DIP) is a way to solve that
    problem. It states
</p>
<blockquote>
    High level components should not depend upon low level components. Both should depend upon abstractions.
</blockquote>
<p>
    This basically means that instead of leveraging concrete classes, we
    should always rely on interfaces. Since our modules are loosely coupled,
    the impact of this inversion principle is kept relatively low.
    Go, compared to other programming languages, makes it easy to 
    comply with the DIP, since interfaces are implemented implicitly.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of this principles are trivial and hence omitted. When testing,
    this principle allows us to inject minimalistic classes that correspond
    to the interface, rather than laboriously overwriting functionality
    and overloading our component tests.
</p>

<h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
<p>
    <b>Dependency Injection</b> (DI) is not part of the <b>SOLID</b> principles, yet
    it has a significant impact on our design, and hence also our tests. Following
    DI, the programmer injects the dependencies, rather than instantiating them
    on the fly. This leads to the encapsulation of the construction logic, as well
    as the flexible replacability of the dependencies.
</p>
<p>
    The following example shows a violation of the DI practice
</p>
<pre><code class="go">type Dep1 interface{}
type Dep2 interface{}

type Svc struct {
    dep1 *Dep1
    dep2 *Dep2
}

func NewSvc() *Svc {
    return &amp;Svc{
        dep1: &amp;Dep1{}, 
        dep2: &amp;Dep2{},
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    If one were to replace, for example, <b>Dep1</b> with another implementation,
    the construction code would have to be altered. To satisfy DI we do the following
</p>
<pre><code class="go">type Dep1 interface{}
type Dep2 interface{}

type Svc struct {
    dep1 *Dep1
    dep2 *Dep2
}

func NewSvc(dep1 *Dep1, dep2 *Dep2) *Svc {
    return &amp;Svc{
        dep1: dep1, 
        dep2: dep2,
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    This subtle change empowers the caller to provide the dependencies. Together with
    the DIP, this leads to the complete independence of the implementation of a class.
    Take a second to appreciate the value we've just gained.
</p>
<p>
    To create unit tests, we have to remove all the dependencies from our component
    to be able to test in isolation. DI, together with the DIP, allows us to do 
    exactly that, thus it is vital to our design.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    The above stated principles all aim at reducing effort and complexity to write 
    tests, as well as to maintain them. Here in short a few best practices to follow
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Follow the five <b>SOLID</b> principles</li>
    <li>Avoid global variables and functions</li>
    <li>Inject dependencies, instead of constructing them or leveraging static or global methods</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All these principles take time to adjust to, yet they ultimately lead to 
    higher quality systems, making them a good investment.
