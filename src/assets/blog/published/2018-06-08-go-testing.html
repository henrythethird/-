<h2>TDD with Go</h2>
<p>
    This post explains the basics of <b>Test Driven Developmen</b> (TDD) in the <b>Go</b> language.
    We'll start with the basics of TDD and then cover a simple example with the factorial function. 
</p>
<h3>The Basics of TDD</h3>
<p>
    The core idea of TDD is to write tests prior to writing code. In contrast to
    <b>Test First Development</b>, TDD is an iterative process, which focusses on one test at a time. 
    There are 3 steps to each cycle:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="color: red">Red</span> - Add a new test for which the code doesn't exist yet. 
        Obviously running the test after this phase will result in a failing test.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="color: green">Green</span> - Add the minimum amount of code to satisfy the test. 
        At this point all tests should succeed.
    </li>
    <li>Refactor - Improve the code without adding functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The cycle is also known as <b>red-green-refactor</b>. After each of these steps, 
    the tests are executed again. This results in good code coverage and incrementally 
    tested code, thus arguably better code quality.
</p>
<h3>An Example</h3>
<p>
    Let's have a look at a concrete example. Mathematical functions are a simple way
    of getting to know the concept of testing, since they can be modelled without 
    including any dependencies. We pick the factorial function, wich is most commonly 
    denoted by <b>n!</b>. The factorial is a mathematical function which takes the 
    product of all positive integers up to the specified parameter n. Let's look at a few 
    examples 
</p>
<pre><code class="bash"># Definition of factorial
$ n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 2 * 1
# Alternative definition
$ n! = n * (n - 1)!
# 0 is a special value
$ 0! = 1
$ 1! = 1
$ 2! = 2 * 1 = 1
$ 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6
$ ...
$ 10! = 10 * 9 * 8 * ... * 2 * 1 = 3'628'800
</code></pre>
<p>
    Without further ado we setup our <b>main.go</b>, which looks as follows
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main.go

package main

func main() {
    // Insert code
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    And our test file <b>main_test.go</b>
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main_test.go

package main

// Empty for now
</code></pre>
<p>
    Like obedient TDD developers we'll start with a test for our 
    <b>factorial</b> function. <b>0! = 1</b> is a special value of this function.
    Let's start there
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main_test.go

package main

import (
    "testing"
)

func TestZero(t *testing.T) {
    res := factorial(0)

    if 1 != res {
        t.Errorf("Expected 0! to be 1, got %d", res)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    With TDD in mind, we run the tests which returns the anticipated output, an error
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ go test
./main_test.go:8: undefined: factorial
FAIL    test [build failed]
</code></pre>
<p>
    Right now we're in the <span style="color: red">red</span> phase. 
    Our tests are failing. The next step is to add as little functionality
    as possible to make our tests pass. We adapt out <b>main.go</b> as 
    follows
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main.go
// ...

func factorial(num int) int {
    return 0
}</code></pre>
<p>
    Now the code compiles and we don't get that compiler error anymore. Yet,
    our software doesn't work as expected yet.
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ go test
--- FAIL: TestZero (0.00s)
main_test.go:10: Expected 0! to be 1, got 0
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL    test      0.006s
</code></pre>
<p>
    This step is crucial to TDD, since it assures us that we aren't shooting shoot 
    blanks. In other words, our test actually checks the functionality instead of
    giving us false positives. Let's fix that really quick
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main.go
// ...

func factorial(num int) int {
    return 1
}</code></pre>
<p>
    Now we run our test again and see <span stlye="color: green">green</span>.
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ go test
PASS
ok      test      0.006s
</code></pre>
<p>
    The code looks quite simple and neat, hence we won't go into the refactor step
    for now. Phew! Let's keep the momentum and move to the next value. <b>1! = 1</b> already
    works - following the protocol, we first make it fail
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main_test.go
// ...

func TestOne(t *testing.T) {
    res := factorial(1)
    if 0 != res {
        t.Errorf("Expected 0! to be 1, got %d", res)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    And fix it again
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main_test.go
// ...

func TestOne(t *testing.T) {
    res := factorial(1)
    if 1 != res {
        t.Errorf("Expected 0! to be 1, got %d", res)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    For the next value we'll add a more generic test case
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main_test.go
// ...

func TestN(t *testing.T) {
    var prov = []struct {
        n   int
        exp int
    }{
        {2, 2},
    }

    for _, tt := range prov {
        act := factorial(tt.n)

        if act != tt.exp {
            t.Errorf("Expected %d! to be %d, got %d", tt.n, tt.exp, act)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Which fails. Now the corresponding functionality
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main.go

func factorial(num int) int {
    if num <= 1 {
        return 1
    }

    return 2
}</code></pre>
<p>
    Fine, we'll stop with the constants now. Let's implement our function
    recursively as in the second definition <b>n! = n * (n - 1)!</b>. We can break
    the current implementation with the test for <b>n = 3</b>. The test can now
    be extended as such
</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main_test.go
// ...

func TestN(t *testing.T) {
    var prov = []struct {
        n   int
        exp int
    }{
        {2, 2},
        {3, 6}, // We added this
    }
    for _, tt := range prov {
        act := factorial(tt.n)

        if act != tt.exp {
            t.Errorf("Expected %d! to be %d, got %d", tt.n, tt.exp, act)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><span style="color: red">Red</span>. Now for the actual code</p>
<pre><code class="go">// file: main.go
func factorial(num int) int {
    if num &lt;= 1 {
        return 1
    }

    return num * factorial(num-1)
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    And so on. I think you get the point
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    <b>TDD</b> enables developers to achieve a <b>high test coverage</b> quickly
    and be more aware of what testable code looks like. It's a great way
    for <em>getting used to testing</em>.
