<h2>CI/CD Pipeline</h2>
<p>
    <b>Continuous Integration</b> (CI) and <b>Continuous Delivery</b> (CD) are essential to
    fast delivery of software. Getting ramped up can be quite cumbersome. This
    post aims at providing a jump start.
</p>
<p>
    First things first, we have to define the two terms
</p>
<blockquote>
    <b>Continuous Integration</b> is a practice of automatically running tests, inspecting code, and building project artifacts to create a continuous feedback loop about the state of the project. It's a verification that the changes can be released without causing a hassle.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <b>Continuous Delivery</b> is a practice of continuously creating working and reliable software increments (without deployment)
</blockquote>
<p>
    Let's start building.
</p>
<h3>The Pipeline</h3>
<p>
    Optimally, the pipeline gets triggered after each commit to the VCS to provide developers 
    with instant feedback about the current project status. The following is a non-exhaustive
    list of steps to consider in a pipeline
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Checkout the project from the VCS</li>
    <li>Install dependencies</li>
    <li>Static code testing</li>
    <li>Dynamic code testing</li>
    <li>Building the deployment artifact</li>
    <li>Deployment to a non-production environment</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition to checking the quality of the code, these steps also make sure that the 
    process is repeatable and reproducible on a generic environment.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Tip: If one of the steps
    should fail on the way, it is crucial that the pipeline is aborted and feedback is
    reported to the developers. A failing pipeline should be the top priority of the
    development team.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Let's go through these steps one by one.
</p>
<h3>Checkout &amp; Dependencies</h3>
<p>
     Here examples for the first two steps
</p>
<pre><code class="bash"># Step one: fetch the code from the repository
$ git clone ssh://git@example.com/path/to/repo.git
# for node dependencies:
$ npm install
# for golang dependencies:
$ dep ensure
</code></pre>
<p>
    The important thing to note here is that for checking out the code you need
    the appropriate access to the repository. It is common practice to issue a
    access token to the CI server for that purpose. Alternatively, a ssh key can
    be generated on the CI server and be added to the runner.
</p>

<h3>Static Code Testing</h3>
<p>
    Static properties of the code base can be used as a first quality gate. There are
    various static code analysis methods
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Linting - Make sure that the source code conforms to the standard and doesn't 
        raise any compiler problems
    </li>
    <li>Mess detection - Measure how "messy" the code is</li>
    <li>Dependency analysis - Ensure that the code follows <em>loose coupling</em></li>
    <li>Security checking - Detect security vulnerabilities early on</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Golang for example features the <b>golint</b> command
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ golint $(go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)
</code></pre>
<p>
    This command returns a non-zero exit code when there are issues with the code base,
    thus aborting the pipeline if the code doesn't conform to the defined guidelines.
</p>

<h3>Dynamic Testing</h3>
<p>
    In contrast to static tests, dynamic tests provide feedback about the
    runtime functionality of the code base.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Tip: In order to be effective, dynamic tests should run in under 10 minutes. The
    feedback loop should be kept short. Long running tests should be scheduled separately
</blockquote>
<p>
    Golang includes the <b>test</b> subcommand. It is executed as such
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ go test $(go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)</code></pre>
<p>
    Similar to the linting process, this command returns a non-zero exit code upon
    failure, printing out the errors into <b>STDERR</b>.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Tip: Developers should have access to the pipeline logs
</blockquote>

<h3>Building the Artifact for Deployment</h3>
<p>
    Different programming environments have different build artifacts. For golang
    this is a compiled static binary, for PHP or python this could be zipped source
    code with all dependencies included. Nowadays, the artifact most commonly is
    a tagged docker image.
</p>
<blockquote>
    Tip: The build step should not be executed on the production system. This way 
    the production system is not exposed to development tooling vulnerabilities.
</blockquote>
<p>
    Golang features the <b>go build</b> command. This squashes the code, together
    with the dependencies, into a single static binary. Here's an example
</p>
<pre><code class="bash">$ go build -ldflags "-extldflags '-static'" -o bin/server.bin</code></pre>
<p>
    This builds the go binary for the same execution environment as the CI server.
    In a second step, this binary can be included into a docker image
</p>
<pre><code class="docker">FROM alpine:3.8
WORKDIR /app
ADD bin/server.bin server.bin
CMD ./server.bin</code></pre>
<p>
    Which can then be built, tagged, and deployed to the appropriate 
    environment
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    The following is an incomplete list of best practices to consider when 
    creating your own pipeline.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trigger the pipeline with every commit</li>
    <li>
        Feedback from the pipeline should be fast
        <ul>
            <li>Fail early - abort the pipeline if a single stage fails</li>
            <li>Consider 10 minutes as a glass ceiling</li>
            <li>If you have test that take too long, consider optimizing or running these tests seperately</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the pipeline fails, it's the utmost priority of the team to fix it</li>
    <li>The developers must have access to the pipeline logs</li>
    <li>Build artifacts on the CI server instead of the production system</li>
    <li>Keep the deployment lean and fast</li>
</ul>
